Download the exe version of AutoMeet at this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yk4rn0rhfov5xl6/AutoMeet.exe?dl=0
To use AutoMeet, download and put both AutoMeet.exe and MeetInfo.txt in the same file, then edit the parimeters in MeetInfo.txt to join google meet links at a given time.
Finally, run AutoMeet.exe and leave it running until the specified time.

Note: rather than using a google meets link send by someone else, please first click on the link, then copy the url to ensure the right user is loged into the google meet.
eg: your link should look like this: "https://meet.google.com/pzb-jhwn-tyi?authuser=0", not this: "https://meet.google.com/lookup/gng5c3bath?authuser=0&hs=179"

To adjust the location of the mouse click, simply edit the "x" and "y" parimeters in MeetInfo.txt
